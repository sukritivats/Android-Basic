        // data sources(array, list etc) --> adapter --> Ui component(list views, spinner,etc)
        // adapters convert data items into view items so that they can be displayed in UI components

   1. create list view in xml
   2. create list of data to add in list view
   3. create adapter -- in which we pass "context, layout (how each item of list view will look), pass data"
   4. set the newly created adapter to our list view
